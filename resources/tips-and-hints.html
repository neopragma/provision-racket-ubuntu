  <h1>Tips and Hints</h1>
    <p>
This system is configured as a learning environment for people interested in learning to program using various Internet-based learning resources.
    </p>
    <h2>
What to do
    </h2>
    <p>
The procedure to follow the curriculum to learn how to program is to read the book, <a href="http://htdp.org"><i>How to Design Programs</i></a>, starting at the beginning. The book provides explanations and presents programming challenges to help you practice and understand the concepts. Other resources are available online to help you get the most from the book, and you can find these on the book's website. Let the book guide you in choosing which exercises to work on and where to find help.
    </p>
    <p>
Once you have a good start at the fundamentals, you may enjoy working with MIT's <i>AppInventor</i> and/or trying different programming languages at the <i>Cyber-Dojo</i> website. 
    </p>
    <h2>
This environment
    </h2>
    <p>
The curriculum to learn programming is based on one developed by Matthias Felleisen at Northeastern University, described at <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Growing_a_Programmer.html">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Growing_a_Programmer.html</a>. The main learning guide is the book, <a href="http://htdp.org"><i>How to Design Programs</i></a> from MIT, available online free of charge. The software <i>DrRacket</i>, which you will use to write your programs, is installed and ready to use. 
    </p>
    <p>
This environment is also configured to support <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">AppInventor</a>, a learning tool provided by MIT. This is a tool for building apps for Android devices. In case you don't have an Android device, we have installed the Android emulator that goes with AppInventor.
    </p>
    <p>
The Firefox web browser has been configured with bookmarks to make it easy for you to find the book and other information you will need. It includes links to <i>DrRacket</i> resources, <i>AppInventor</i> resources, and a free online programming practice site called <i>Cyber-Dojo</i>, where you can try your hand at programming in several different languages.

The Ubuntu launcher has the following icons:

    <h2>
The documentation
    </h2>
    <p>
You will see many references to <i>Scheme</i> and <i>DrScheme</i> in the Internet references for the book and the learning program. These are the older names of <i>Racket</i> and <i>DrRacket</i>. Most of the information that references <i>DrScheme</i> applies to <i>DrRacket</i>, as well. So, don't worry about the difference in names.
    </p>
    <p>
More than one edition of the book is online. You may find the explanations easier to understand in one version versus another. For example, here are links to the explanation of the same concept in two editions of the book:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-5.html">from the September 26, 2003 edition</a></li> 
        <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/part_one.html">from the Second Edition, as of October 24, 2015</a></li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
You can always check both editions, as well as any newer editions that may be published, to see which explanation makes the most sense to you. 
    </p>
    <p>
The main page of the book's website, at <a href="http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/">http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/</a>, has links to several useful resources. You should take a look at these and familiarize yourself with the kinds of questions each one can answer for you. A particularly useful resource is the <i>Companion</i>, at <a href="http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Companion/">http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Companion/</a>. The structure of the <i>companion</i> parallels that of the book, and provides practical help for doing the exercises.
